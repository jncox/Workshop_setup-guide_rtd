Xtract for VMs
-------------------

Overview
++++++++

In this exercise you will deploy, and use the Xtract tools to migrate a VM.

Deploy Xtract for VMs from CLI
+++++++++++++++++

Downloaded, and unzip **xtract-vm-1.1.2-release.zip** from the Nutanix Portal.

Open a Shell on your laptop, and navigate to the unzipped xtract directory.

Run **"ls -l"**, and you will see the 3 different cli options.

You will launch the utility for your OS (Windows or OS X), and point to your teams HPOC.

  .. code-block:: bash

    ./cli-darwin-amd64-1.1.2 -c 10.21.xx.37

Next you will be promted to enter the **admin** Password.

Now you can deploy the **Xtract** VM.

To do this you will need the name of your **storage container**, **Network**, and **IP Address**.

For this exercise we will use a static IP, you will need this information:

- **IP Address** - 10.21.XX.42
- **Netmask** - 255.255.255.128
- **Gateway** - 10.21.XX.1
- **DNS1** - 10.21.253.10
- **DNS2** - 10.21.253.11
- **Search Domains** - nutanixdc.local

  .. code-block:: bash

    deploy-vm vm-container CONTAINER-NAME vm-network Primary ip-address 10.21.XX.42 netmask 255.255.255.128 gateway 10.21.XX.1 dns1 10.21.253.10 dns2 10.21.253.11 searchdomains nutanixdc.local

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm04.png
